# Square Code Encryption

This is a simple web application that implements the classic method for composing secret messages using Square Code Encryption.

## How it Works

The application takes a user input message, normalizes it by removing all spaces and special characters, and then encodes it using Square Code Encryption. The encoded message is displayed as a rectangle with c chunks of r length, separated by spaces.

## Usage

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Enter your message in the input field provided.
2. Click on the "Encrypt" button to encode your message.
3. The normalized rectangle will be displayed in the "Normalized Rectangle" section.
4. The encoded chunks will be displayed in the "Encoded Chunks" section.
5. And the last input displays the encoded rectangle.

## Technologies Used

This application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
